# compi-graph-cut
School Project on Graph-Cut Image Segementation from the course Computational Imaging of IMT Atlantique

# Requirements:
- NetworkX
- PyMaxflow (if you want to use the library from the paper)

# Setup
## Install PyMaxflow

```
pip install PyMaxflow
```
Tested on linux, it works fine. For Windows, you need to get a C++ Compiler from Visual Studio (v14).
